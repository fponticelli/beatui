When a new component is added to the project, create a new page in the `docs` project that shows its usage. Keep it terse with no code examples, just render the component and if useful put the options for it in the `ControlsHeader` component so that it can be rendered with different options.

The new page should be referenced in the menu and added to the routing system.
