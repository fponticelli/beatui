description: "rules to apply when writing TypeScript code"

- Always prefer avoid using `any` and try to find correct types
- Prefer `??` operator over `||` when applicable
- When using conditionals always use an operator explicitly and avoid using Falsy/Truthy notations. When comparing for undefined/null always use `== null` or `!= null`
