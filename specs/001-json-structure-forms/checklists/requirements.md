# Specification Quality Checklist: JSON Structure Form Components

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- The spec properly distinguishes between JSON Structure (the schema language) and the existing JSON Schema implementation
- All 12 user stories are prioritized (P1-P3) and independently testable
- 22 functional requirements cover all JSON Structure types and features
- 9 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- 8 assumptions document reasonable defaults and scope boundaries
- Edge cases section identifies 7 boundary conditions to consider during implementation
