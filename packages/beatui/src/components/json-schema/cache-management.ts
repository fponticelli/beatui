/**
 * CACHING ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS:
 *
 * 1. AJV Instance Lifetime:
 *    - Each form creates its own AJV instance via getAjvForSchema()
 *    - AJV instances are NOT shared between forms to avoid:
 *      * Schema pollution (one form's schemas affecting another)
 *      * Concurrency issues in multi-threaded environments
 *      * Complex cache invalidation when schemas change
 *
 * 2. Validator Compilation Cache:
 *    - Keyed by: AJV instance -> Schema object identity
 *    - Lifetime: Lives as long as the AJV instance exists
 *    - Thread-safe: Uses WeakMap for automatic cleanup
 *    - Scope: Per-AJV instance (form-level isolation)
 *
 * 3. $ref Resolution Cache:
 *    - Keyed by: Root schema object -> Definition object
 *    - Lifetime: Lives as long as the root schema exists
 *    - Thread-safe: Uses WeakMap for automatic cleanup
 *    - Scope: Global (shared across forms for efficiency)
 *
 * 4. External Schema Cache:
 *    - Managed by AJV's internal addSchema() mechanism
 *    - Lifetime: Per-AJV instance
 *    - Scope: Form-level (each form has its own external schemas)

/**
 * THREAD SAFETY GUARANTEES:
 *
 * 1. WeakMap Operations:
 *    - All cache operations use WeakMaps which are thread-safe for reads
 *    - Cache clearing uses atomic WeakMap reassignment
 *    - No explicit locking required
 *
 * 2. AJV Instance Isolation:
 *    - Each form gets its own AJV instance
 *    - No shared mutable state between forms
 *    - External schema registration is per-instance
 *
 * 3. Memory Management:
 *    - WeakMaps automatically cleanup when objects are garbage collected
 *    - No manual memory management required in normal operation
 *    - clearAllCaches() provides explicit cleanup for testing/debugging

/**
 * PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
 *
 * 1. Cache Hit Performance:
 *    - O(1) lookup for compiled validators
 *    - O(1) lookup for resolved $refs
 *    - Minimal overhead for cache checks
 *
 * 2. Cache Miss Performance:
 *    - AJV compilation: ~1-10ms per schema (depends on complexity)
 *    - $ref resolution: ~0.1-1ms per reference
 *    - External schema loading: Network-dependent
 *
 * 3. Memory Usage:
 *    - Compiled validators: ~1-10KB per schema
 *    - Resolved refs: ~100B-1KB per reference
 *    - Automatic cleanup via WeakMap garbage collection
 */

/**
 * RECOMMENDED USAGE PATTERNS:
 *
 * 1. Production Applications:
 *    - Let caches accumulate naturally
 *    - Use clearAllCaches() only for memory pressure
 *    - Monitor via getCacheStats() if needed
 *
 * 2. Testing:
 *    - Call clearAllCaches() in beforeEach hooks
 *    - Ensures test isolation
 *    - Prevents cache-related test flakiness
 *
 * 3. Development:
 *    - Use clearCachesForForm() when schema changes
 *    - Call clearAllCaches() when switching projects
 *    - Monitor cache stats for performance debugging
